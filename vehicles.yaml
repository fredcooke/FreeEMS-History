    story: "Marcos sent me a Puma Spin 1 board and I couldn't help but try it out on something, so why not a 400hp turbo four cylinder? It was about time to bin the old MS2 anyway!"
    thread: "http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?f=55&t=1069"
    status: "I installed a new bottom end after blowing the old one on MS2 (my fault) and didn't realise that it had thin rods and blew it too (my fault again) so uninstalled the Puma and put it into the next car."
